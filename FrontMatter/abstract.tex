%We would like to express our deep and sincere gratitude to our research supervisor, \emph{\Supervisor}, for giving us the opportunity to conduct research and providing invaluable guidance throughout this work. His dynamism, vision, sincerity and motivation have deeply inspired us. He has taught us the methodology to carry out the work and to present the works as clearly as possible. It was a great privilege and honor to work and study under his guidance. 
%
%We are greatly indebted to our honorable teachers of the Department of \Department at the \University who taught us during the course of our study. Without any doubt, their teaching and guidance have completely transformed us to the persons that we are today.
%
%We are extremely thankful to our parents for their unconditional love, endless prayers and caring, and immense sacrifices for educating and preparing us for our future. We would like to say thanks to our friends and relatives for their kind support and care.

%Finally, we would like to thank all the people who have supported us to complete the project work directly or indirectly.

FM transmitter is a small device that can transmit Frequency Modulated
signal over short range. This document consists of most simple and
economical technique for building a FM transmitter using basic electronic
components like resistor, capacitor, inductor etc. The FM transmitter receives
human voice signals through microphone. It further amplifies it, modulate it
over carrier and finally transmit it. Assuming favorable conditions, output of
transmitter can be received by anyone who tunes it in frequency of our
transmitter. Here, we have described the circuit diagram, its working,
components required, uses of various components in our circuit, its practical
applicability. This design is capable of transmitting signal for distance of
200 m, tuned at FM range (88 MHz- 108 MHz). One could clearly hear sound produced at
microphone of transmitter.
