FM TRANSMITTER is an electronic device, which produce frequency modulated waves with
the help of an antenna. A transmitter generates FM waves for various purpose such as
communication, broadcasting a message etc. Furthermore, FM signals are less prone to
interference as compared to AM signals due to higher bandwidth. Also, it less susceptible to
noise. The signal transmitted has a limited range for its reception, as we increase our
distance from source, the signal received is merged with noise and further more noise
component dominates the signal transmitted and hence message cannot be received
successfully after certain distance due to obstacles. The source of power is 12V dc battery.
The information that is provided to the transmitter is in the form of an electronic signal. This
includes audio from a microphone. The transmitter combines the information signal that is
to be carried with the FM signal. This is called modulation. In an FM transmitter, the
information is added to the radio signal by slightly varying the radio signalâ€™s frequency.
