\chapter{The Electrical Power System}
The Electrical Power System (EPS) is an electronic circuit board that is designed
to supply, manage and store energy in an efficient way. The EPS must be
able to harvest energy from the solar panels and store it in the battery, as well as
delivering power to the satellite, using switch controlled converters to supply a
regulated voltage. Redundant circuitry must be present to ensure continuous and reliable operation of the satellite in case of the failure of EPS components.
\\
The output of the solar panels is first run through the power path control. While in
sunlight operation, the power path will select the voltage from the panels based on
its higher voltage. The output of the Power Path control is sent to DC-DC converters to provide 5V and 3.3V regulated DC supply for the CubeSat modules. During the eclipse, the power path will select the battery to power the circuit components.
\\
The software is implemented in order to manage the overall energy of the satellite,
regulate the converters to extract maximum power from solar panels, perform
power diagnostics, engage redundant circuitry and to communicate with the On
Board Computer. The software also employs four operating modes: Initialization
mode, Safe mode, Normal mode and Low Power Mode.

\section[Components of EPS]{Components of EPS}
The EPS of a CubeSat can be designed with many different architectures, but some
components are common to all designs, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Solar panels to harvest the energy from the Sun
	\item Battery charger to manage the charging profile of the battery
	\item Voltage regulators to feed the regulated power bus of the satellite
	\item Remove Before Flight (RBF) switches and deployment switches, to cut the
	power while the satellite is not deployed
\end{itemize}
Other components of the EPS are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Battery and associated charging circuit
	\item Solar panels on 6 faces of the satellite
	\item MPPT converters which help optimise power collection from the sun
	\item Buck and boost converters which help provide required voltage busses for
	components of different voltages
	\item  An MCU which controls the tasks that the EPS performs and
	monitors the status of the components
	\item Over Current Protection Circuit which helps protects important components from
	high current flow
	\item  Current and Voltage sensors to keep track of their consumption.
	\item  Temperature sensors to measure battery temperature, based on which battery
	heater is used
	\item Battery heater circuit
\end{itemize}
\section[Tasks of EPS]{Tasks of EPS}
Tasks of the EPS are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collect housekeeping for various components associated with it, like the various
	current \& voltage sensors and the batteryâ€™s state of charge.
	\item Handle housekeeping requests and other commands from the OBC (ON/OFF requests of any subsystem by OBC).
	\item  Implement MPPT to optimize power generation.
	\item  Control the Simple Beacon (which contains only the call sign of the satellite)
	before the TTC gets switched on.
	\item  Implement a watchdog timer to keep a check on the operation of the OBC.
	\item   Take action on the basis of OCPC triggers.
	\item  Deployment of antenna at the time of satellite initialisation.
	\item  Turn on the battery heater when temperature goes below critical level
\end{itemize}
