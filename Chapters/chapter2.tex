\section{Conclusion}
After conducting proper literature study, we have decided upon the type of architecture to be implemented on the EPS and have formed the specifications of the components. The design of all the circuits was also completed and PCB design was started. Next, we are planning to procure all the components and design the PCB layouts. We look forward to completing the project as per the schedule.
\section{Future Scope}
The STM 32 Micro-controller could be used to monitor and display the voltage and current levels of the different buses and hence determine whether a bus is operating or not. Also, the micro-controller could be used to provide the PWM for the converter in the MPPT circuit depending upon the available irradiance by following an algorithm.
